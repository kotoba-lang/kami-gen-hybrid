  "ADR-2607051130 (Approach 4 of 4, `com-junkawasaki/root` /
  `90-docs/adr/2607051130-kami-gen-hybrid-rig-texture-pipeline.md`):
  deterministic parametric rig/body from `kotoba-lang/character`, with
  ONLY the costume's surface appearance ML-generated (a `comfyui-clj`
  texture node graph), assembled into a `.vrm` via `kotoba-lang/vrm`.

  What's real in this namespace: body/rig generation (a real call into
  `kotoba-lang/character`'s own `generate-character`), the `comfyui-clj`
  workflow graph and its execution (a real node registry, real topological
  execution, real validation against that engine's own schema), and VRM
  assembly/export (a real GLB/VRM file with real embedded geometry,
  skinning, and texture images). What's NOT real: diffusion image
  generation. `execute-texture` is an injected capability — this repo's
  tests and its own demonstration run always inject
  `kami.gen.hybrid.texture/mock-execute-texture` (deterministic checkerboard/
  flat-normal fixture PNGs, real files with real pixels, not learned
  output). See the README for why: this org's own `network-isekai/backend`
  lists image/SDXL generation as \"skeleton only, TODO\" as of 2026-07-05.

  Unlike its three portable (`.cljc`) dependencies (`character`,
  `comfyui-clj`, `vrm`), this repo's own orchestration/glue code is
  JVM-only `.clj` — it needs real file IO (`javax.imageio` PNG encode,
  `java.nio.file` reads) that isn't part of what those libraries' own
  portability contracts cover."

(defn bare-body
  "Calls `character/generate-character` for `base` and strips its
  `\"clothing\"` mesh part. ADR-2607051130: the whole point of this
  hybrid split is that costume comes from TEXTURE (the diffusion-generated
  albedo/normal/roughness maps applied to the bare body's own `:skin`
  material), not from extra procedural costume geometry the way
  `kami-gen-procedural`'s kigurumi hood/bodysuit approach does — so this
  is `compose-costumed-character`'s body half, minus that geometry,
  exactly as the ADR specifies. Guaranteed-valid topology/UVs/blendshapes
  come straight from `character`'s own generation + its own test suite (66
  deftest forms / 17,843 assertions) — nothing about that guarantee is
  re-verified here, it's inherited.

  Returns `{:parts :skeleton :blendshape-targets :character-def}` — the
  same shape `character/generate-character` returns, plus `:character-def`
  (the resolved def, needed downstream by `kami.gen.hybrid.vrm-export` for
  per-material PBR factors)."

    capability, `(fn [params] -> {:width :height :format :rgba8 :pixels
    <byte-array>})`. `kami.gen.hybrid.texture/mock-execute-texture` for
    tests/demos; `real-execute-texture` for a live backend (throws loudly
    without a configured `:endpoint` — see its docstring).
  - `:output-dir` — where generated PNGs + the final `.vrm` are written
    (default: a fresh temp dir).
  - `:graph-builder` — `(fn [costume-prompt opts] -> {:workflow :targets})`,
    default `kami.gen.hybrid.workflow/costume-prompt->workflow` (a pure
    template; the injection seam for a future LLM-authored graph builder
    that varies node structure, not just these fixed slots — see that
    namespace's docstring).
  - `:base-resolution` — texture-slot px size (default 256).

  Returns `{:body :workflow :textures :vrm}` per the ADR."

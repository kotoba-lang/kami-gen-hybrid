  "Texture-generation capability implementations, injected into the
  `comfyui-clj` workflow's `KSampler` node (`kami.gen.hybrid.nodes/pack`) —
  the DI seam ADR-2607051130 calls for (\"the diffusion compute is injected
  as a host capability\").

  Two implementations:

  - `mock-execute-texture` — returns real, per-pixel RGBA image data (a
    checkerboard for :albedo/:roughness, a flat tangent-space normal for
    :normal) sized to the caller's `:width`/`:height`. This is what tests
    and this repo's own demonstration run use. It is NOT a diffusion model:
    the pixels are a deterministic function of `:prompt`/`:seed`/`:channel`,
    not a learned image. `kami.gen.hybrid.nodes/->SaveTextureImage` writes
    the returned pixels to a real PNG file on disk (real bytes, real file,
    just not a diffusion sample).
  - `real-execute-texture` — a thin wrapper shaped for a live SDXL/FLUX-
    backed ComfyUI HTTP endpoint. It is structurally complete (submits a
    prompt, polls history, downloads the resulting image) but there is no
    live endpoint in this dev environment to call: `network-isekai/backend`
    (this org's own generation backend) lists image/SDXL generation as
    \"skeleton only, TODO\" in its README status table as of 2026-07-05.
    Calling it without `:endpoint` configured throws immediately and
    loudly rather than silently falling back to a mock."

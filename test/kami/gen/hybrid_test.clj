;; ── real bug fix regression: eye/face/hair skin weights bind to the head,
;; not the shoulders ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; Hand-verified real bug (not hypothetical): `character/generate-
;; character`'s head/eye/eyebrow/hair parts come out in HEAD-LOCAL
;; coordinates (centred near the world origin), but `vrm-export.clj` used
;; to feed those untranslated positions straight into `character.body/
;; skin-weights` alongside genuinely WORLD-space bone positions — two
;; different coordinate spaces compared as one. Decoding a real exported
;; GLB's JOINTS_0/WEIGHTS_0 showed eye_white/iris/pupil vertices ~90-100%
;; dominantly bound to `leftShoulder`/`rightShoulder` (an eye vertex's
;; top-4 joints didn't even include `head`), and `hair` skewing toward
;; `chest`/`neck`/`spine`/`rightShoulder`. Fixed by `to-world-space`
;; (translates head-local parts by the `head` bone's world position before
;; any skin-weighting or GLB serialization happens — see that fn's
;; docstring/namespace comment in `vrm_export.clj`). This test decodes the
;; real exported artifact and would have caught the original bug.
